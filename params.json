The library includes a hierarchy of Geometry objects. Although developed as part of the [GeoPackage Libraries](http://ngageoint.github.io/GeoPackage/), this library does not contain GeoPackage functionality and can be used separately.\r\n\r\n### Usage ###\r\n\r\n#### Read ####\r\n\r\n    //NSData * bytes = ...    \r\n    \r\n    WKBByteReader * reader = [[WKBByteReader alloc] initWithData:bytes];\r\n    [reader setByteOrder:CFByteOrderBigEndian];\r\n    WKBGeometry * geometry = [WKBGeometryReader readGeometryWithReader:reader];\r\n    WKBGeometryType geometryType = geometry.geometryType;\r\n\r\n#### Write ####\r\n\r\n    //WKBGeometry * geometry = ...\r\n    \r\n    WKBByteWriter * writer = [[WKBByteWriter alloc] init];\r\n    [writer setByteOrder:CFByteOrderBigEndian];\r\n    [WKBGeometryWriter writeGeometry:geometry withWriter:writer];\r\n    NSData * bytes = [writer getData];\r\n    [writer close];\r\n\r\n### Build ###\r\n\r\nBuild this repository using Xcode and/or CocoaPods:\r\n\r\n    pod install\r\n\r\nOpen wkb-ios.xcworkspace in Xcode\r\n\r\n### Include Library ###\r\n\r\nUse this repository by specifying it in a Podfile using a supported option:\r\n\r\n    pod 'wkb-ios', :git => 'https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-wkb-iOS.git', :branch => 'master'\r\n    pod 'wkb-ios', :git => 'https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-wkb-iOS.git', :tag => '1.0.0'\r\n    pod 'wkb-ios', :path => '../wkb-ios'\r\n    pod 'wkb-ios', '~> 1.0' # Not yet supported, CocoaPod coming soon\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
